### Hi, I'm Sam. Lovely to meet you ðŸ˜„ 

I like to consider myself a technical writer, though perhaps 'communicator' would be a more apt description. I have a background in health and science research, copyediting, and documentation.

You can check out my portfolio, [darling docs](https://darlingdocs.wordpress.com/), to view a collection of my previous projects. 

I look forward to working with you.
